<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; max-width:850px; margin:auto;">
I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, exploring how they merge with human spontaneity to create intelligent, human-centric solutions.<br><br>
Artificial Intelligence has always fascinated me because it represents the closest bridge between human imagination and technological execution. My journey started with learning Python, and soon expanded into Machine Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.<br><br>
One of my most exciting personal concepts is <strong>Spontaneous AI Thought</strong> — a vision for AI systems that capture human ideas instantly and transform them into meaningful actions. The goal is not just automation, but human-centric AI that works alongside people, amplifying creativity and decision-making.<br><br>
This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects; it’s a reflection of my belief that technology should inspire, assist, and empower people. The future I envision is one where AI doesn’t replace humans — it makes us more human.
